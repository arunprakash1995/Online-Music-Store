# Online-Music_store
MusicStore is an online website that allows customers to purchase downloadable music instead of physical CDs. Since customers download music that is purchased, our website does not store information such as the customer's shipping address. Instead, only basic credentials like the name and email of customers are stored. Moreover, we assumed that the customer would only purchase one instance of a song. Therefore, the cart has no option to adjust the quantity of a particular song. We have also made the website user-friendly. Users can easily traverse and search for an item using the search bar. Furthermore, tabs within the website allow users to find songs by artist or album. We have also included an admin page that allows an admin to add, update, and remove (implemented a soft delete) items and their corresponding image.
